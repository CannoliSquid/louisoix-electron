        <h1 class="display-2"> About the App </h1>
        <p>
            This app was initially created for a few different reasons: 
            <br><br>1. Explore Electron and Vue.JS
            <br>2. Use it while I play FFXIV.
            <br>3. Utilize some of the great work I have seen in the FFXIV fan/dev community.
            <br><br>
            <a href="https://xivapi.com/">XIVAPI</a>, <a href="https://collect.raelys.com/">FFXIV Collect</a>, 
            and so many other great resources have been mad by really cool devs in the community and they have 
            been kind enough to produce APIs, so I definitely wanted to leverage their works.

        <p>
            This is the least important piece of the 'About' page. I don't have much to say about myself. 
            I'm just a full-time software dev that likes gaming and music.
